Here are my Gitlab projects.

Gitlab_final: Main branch, which contain the final result with all merging of the other branch.
Gitlab_Issue: Script which let us login within the registry
Gitlab_Build: Build an image after the login
Gitlab_Run: Run the image we created from Gitlab_Build
Gitlab_Test: Test unit

It was an exercice which we needed to integrate a existing repo into ours, which is why there are files from another source.
